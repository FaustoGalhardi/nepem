# Details
[My homepage](nepemufsc.com) is done with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and based on [Academic](https://themes.gohugo.io/academic/) theme. [My publication page](https://olivoto.netlify.app/publication/) is inspired on [Walmes Zeviani's page](http://www.leg.ufpr.br/~walmes/home/publications/). I have used portions of his code to generate the plot.
