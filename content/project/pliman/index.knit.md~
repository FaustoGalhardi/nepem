`pliman` (**pl**ant **im**age **an**alysis) is designed to analyze plant images, especially related to leaf analysis. You provide color palettes, tell `pliman` what each one represents, and it takes care of the details. Image indexes can also be used to segment images. The package will help you to:

* Measure leaf area with `leaf_area()`
* Measure disease severity with `symptomatic_area()`
* Count the number of lesions with `count_lesions()`
* Count objects in an image with `count_objects()`
* Get the RGB values for each object in an image with `objects_rgb()`
* Get object measures with `get_measures()`
* Plot object measures with `plot_measures()`

`pliman` also provides useful functions for [operation](https://tiagoolivoto.github.io/pliman/reference/image_combine.html), [transformation](https://tiagoolivoto.github.io/pliman/reference/utils_transform.html), and [segmentation](https://tiagoolivoto.github.io/pliman/reference/image_binary.html) of images. Please, visit the [Examples](https://tiagoolivoto.github.io/pliman/index.html) page in `pliman` website for a detailed documentation of each function.
