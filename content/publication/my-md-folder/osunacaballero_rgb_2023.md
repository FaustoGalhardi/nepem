abstract = "Rust is a damaging disease affecting vital crops, including pea, and identifying highly resistant genotypes remains a challenge. Accurate measurement of infection levels in large germplasm collections is crucial for finding new resistance sources. Current evaluation methods rely on visual estimation of disease severity and infection type under field or controlled conditions. While they identify some resistance sources, they are error-prone and time-consuming. An image analysis system proves useful, providing an easy-to-use and affordable way to quickly count and measure rust-induced pustules on pea samples. This study aimed to develop an automated image analysis pipeline for accurately calculating rust disease progression parameters under controlled conditions, ensuring reliable data collection."
