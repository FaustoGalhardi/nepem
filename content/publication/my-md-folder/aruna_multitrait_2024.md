abstract = "Multi-environment trials (met) are crucial for selecting genotypes that are well-suited to different environmental conditions. Incorporating multiple traits in the analysis can provide more reliable recommendations for selecting genotypes with desirable traits, including resistance to the mungbean yellow mosaic virus (mymv) and high yield potential. The use of a multi-trait stability index (mtsi) is a good approach for analyzing the stability of genotypes across multiple traits under mymv stress. In the present investigation, the performance of thirteen green gram genotypes were evaluated for traits such as yield, plant height, number of branches per plant, and resistance to mymv. The main objective of the study is to identify highly productive and stable mung bean genotypes resistant to mymv. Mtsi can be calculated by combining information on the performance of genotypes across multiple traits and environmental conditions to provide a single index that indicates the overall stability of genotypes across traits and environments. The results helped to identify two green gram genotypes (yadadri and jng-18) that were high-yielding with stable resistance to mymv stress across multiple environmental conditions. This can provide useful information to breeders for the development of suitable genotypes against mymv in the affected areas."
