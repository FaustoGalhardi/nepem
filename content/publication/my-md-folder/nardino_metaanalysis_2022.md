abstract = "Abstract a large set of variables is assessed for progeny selection in a plant-breeding program and other agronomic fields. The meta-analysis of the coefficient of variation (cve) produces information for researchers and breeders on the experimental quality of trials. This analysis can also be applied in the decision-making process of the experimental plan regarding the experimental design, the number of repetitions, and the treatments and plants/progenies to be measured. In this study, we evaluated the dataset distribution and the descriptive statistics of cve through the frequentist and bayesian approaches, aiming to establish the credibility and confidence intervals. We submitted cve data of ten wheat (triticum aestivum l.) traits reported in 1,068 articles published to the bayesian and frequentist analyses. Sample data were analyzed via gamma and normal models. We selected the model with the lowest akaike information criterion (aic) value, and then we tested three link functions. In the bayesian analysis, uniform distributions were used as non-informative priors for the gamma distribution parameters with three ranges of qtextasciitildeu (a,b,). Thus, the prior probability density function was given by: pθ = 1β-α, θ ∈ α,β. The bayesian and frequentist approaches with the gamma model presented similar results for cve; however, the range bayesian credible intervals was narrower than the frequentist confidence intervals. Gamma distribution fitted the cve data better than the normal distribution. The credible and confidence intervals of cve were successfully applied to wheat traits and could be used as experimental accuracy measurements in other experiments."
