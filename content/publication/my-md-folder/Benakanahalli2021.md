abstract = "Guar, the most popular vegetable, is tolerant of drought and is a valuable industrial crop enormously grown across india, pakistan, usa, and south africa for pharmaceutically and cosmetically usable galactomannan (gum) content present in seed endosperm. Guar genotypes with productive traits which could perform better in differential environmental conditions are of utmost priority for genotype selection. This could be achieved by employing multivariate trait analysis. In this context, multi-trait stability index (mtsi) and multi-trait genotype-ideotype distance index (mgidi) were employed for identifying high-performing genotypes exhibiting multiple traits. In the current investigation, 85 guar accessions growing in different seasons were assessed for 15 morphological traits. The results obtained by mtsi and mgidi indexes revealed that, out of 85, only 13 genotypes performed better across and within the seasons, and, based on the coincidence index, only three genotypes (ic-415106, ic-420320, and ic-402301) were found stable with high seed production in multi-environmental conditions. View on strengths and weakness as described by the mgidi reveals that breeders concentrated on developing genotype with desired traits, such as quality of the gum and seed yield. The strength of the ideal genotypes in the present work is mainly focused on high gum content, short crop cycle, and high seed yield possessing good biochemical traits. Thus, mtsi and mgidi serve as a novel tool for desired genotype selection process simultaneously in plant breeding programs across multi-environments due to uniqueness and ease in interpreting data with minimal multicollinearity issues."
