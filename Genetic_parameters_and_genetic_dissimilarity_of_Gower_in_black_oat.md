abstract = "Abstract: this research evaluated the agronomic performance through mixed models, and determined the genetic divergence between black oat genotypes. The experiment was carried out at federal university of santa maria, frederico westphalen/rs. Fourteen black oat genotypes were evaluated, being 11 lines developed by breeding program of university, and three commercial cultivars (iapar 61, upfa 21 - moreninha and, ipr cabocla). We evaluated quantitative traits associated to plant height, cycle, dry mass yield and seeds yield; and 19 qualitative traits, being these morphological descriptors. The results showed that lines ufsmfw 2-05 and ufsmfw 2-07 stand out with characteristics such as early cycle, higher dry mass and grain yield. Divergence analysis revealed the formation of three distinct groups, indicating the presence of variability. These results suggested the potential for the development of new cultivars of black oat, presenting early cycle and good grain yield."
